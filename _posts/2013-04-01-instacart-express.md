I try to resist complaining, but one of my favorite startups have let me down in a big way.

Last year when Instacart first offered what they called "Instacart Express", I jumped on the wagon and paid the $99.00 for unlimited free deliveries.

Around mid-march I started noticing some odd charges for deliveries. I was getting charged a **$7.99** delivery fee on orders that are under $35.

I'm explicitly paying this money up front per/year to avoid delivery charges per/order.  This is the reason I use Instacart vs. my other favorite, Postmates (who have a $7.99 per order fee).

I immediately went and checked the terms [located here](https://www.instacart.com/terms) and it seems that there is no mention of either Instacart Express or delivery fees.  I can't find any other delivery terms or policies on the site regarding this.  

So I emailed Instacart…

> Hi Instacart,
>
> I've been an express member for a while now and my past few orders have been subject to a $7.99 delivery fee for under $30.
> 
> When I purchased my express subscription as well as renewed it recently (auto renewal) I was under the impression that the $99 p/year covered all delivery fees no matter the amount of the order.
> 
> The two orders in question are: xxx, xxx
> 
> Thanks,
> Caleb

The next morning, I get my response…

> HI Caleb
>
> So sorry for the confusion regarding this.
> 
> We made changes to our policy in regards to the Express feature and sent out an email.  I apologize if for some reason you did not receive it.
> 
> Orders must be a minimum of $35 now in order to receive free delivery as an Express member.
> 
> Please let me know if you have any questions.
> Mike

It seems that they've made some changes to their policy but yet I did not receive an email, my wife didn't receive an email, nor did a collegue who also has Instacart Express receive an email.  We did however get the usual free delivery notification via Instacart (2 or 3 per week), but none of us have received this "policy update" email, nor have we seen a Tweet or otherwise mention of this change.

I'm highly disappointed that this feature was modified in this way and even more disappointed that more of an effort was not made to contact me regarding this change or even a link in the email response to the updated terms that I can see.

I plan on not using Instacart again for the foreseable future until they can work out these kinks in notifying customers about large policy changes that affect the things they've paid for.

**TL;DR:** Instacart offers free unlimited delivery on orders for $99 a year, they seem to have silently changed their policy and now charged $7.99 p/delivery for orders under $35.  They also claim to have sent an email regarding this policy that at least 3 people have not received.
