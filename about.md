My name is Caleb Mingle and I'm a software engineer at Mavenlink.

I've worked on jobs in a wide variety of industries besides software:

+ Alarm System Installer
+ Electrical Apprentice
+ Carpentry / Construction
+ Masonry Work
+ Cabinetmaking
+ Sign and Decal Production

I'm married to my beautiful wife Paige and we live in the Parkside neighborhood of San Francisco, CA.

I love all kinds of soda and am addicted to Mountain Dew.
